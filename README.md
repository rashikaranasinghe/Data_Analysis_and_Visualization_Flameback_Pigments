## Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) Analysis Pipeline

The GWAS_using_GEMMA_pipeline.rtf file provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide for conducting GWAS using the GEMMA software. It outlines the complete workflow including:
*  Genotype file preparation
*  Phenotype data integration
*  Kinship matrix generation
*  Association testing

## Data Files
This repository includes cleaned and processed datasets used in the analyses:
*  Colorimetric.Data-Dinopium_mantle_and_crown_from_pavo.csv
Contains extracted colorimetric variables for mantle and crown feather samples, generated using the pavo R package. Each row represents a single feather sample.

*  HPLC_data_Mantle_Crown_feathers_All_Dinopium.csv
Carotenoid pigment concentrations (in Î¼g/g) measured from mantle and crown feathers using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC).

*  Genotype_ReadDepth_data-GWAS-SNP.csv
Genotype data for SNPs significantly associated with the phenotypic trait in the GWAS analysis, along with standardized read depth for each individual.
